4.4: I do not delude myself into thinking that this would be a way for me to live again, 
     because I am not that air, I am the pattern that it assumed, temporarily. The pattern that is me, 
     the patterns that are the entire world in which I live, would be gone.
    我不会欺骗自己说，这是我再生的方式，因为我不是那些空气，我只是空气流动模式的体现，暂时的体现。我是一种模式，
    我所存在的整个世界也是一种模式，而这一切都将不复存在。
